Wikipedia:
"Connect Four - a two-player connection game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs from the top into a seven-column, 
six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the next available space within the column. 
The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs."
